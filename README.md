### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am an undergraduate student studying in the field of Electrical & Computer Engineering and I love to code and develop software!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently (mainly) working on ATTCS, a React learning project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Electrical Engineering, Programming (school) and Front-end development (for fun)
